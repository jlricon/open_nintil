# Rules of Research

## Goals

If one wants to know about X such that at the time of finishing the relevant research there is no piece of evidence that will change your mind, what should one do? That is, how does one effectively aggregate the sum total of knowledge that mankind has on a given topic, up to the time of writing?

That knowledge is usually found in academic papers and textbooks. If we are interested in very narrow questions, then we will probably have papers that will cover those questions sufficiently so that we won't need the books. Books are good if one is not familiar with a topic, to gain an overall view, but to answer questions they are not that relevant.

This is usually where academic literature reviews end, but this is not enough for Nintil. There is a lot of valuable knowledge on reddit, blogs, or twitter that can also be unconvered. As an example, if one is interested on the causes for US medical expenditures one will be well advised to take a look at [Random Critical Analysis](https://randomcriticalanalysis.com/).

Academic material is not magical in any sense, nor is peer review, a blog may well be the state of the art on a topic, and so they shouldn't be overlooked just because they are not behind a pricey paywall.

## Method

Literature reviews at Nintil begin with a search on Google Scholar for _relevant terms_. These are just keywords related to what we want, again with US medical expenditures, we may search _US medical expenditures_ as such or _healthcare US spending_. That will get us some results. If we see anything with the magic words **meta** or **systematic**, we open that first. Systematic literature reviews have already done most of the work for us, and likewise meta-analysis offer an all-things considered quantitative assessment of a topic.

If we find systematic review or meta-analysis then we read them (More on that later). But that's not the end!

Then we open the list of citations that the paper got and repeat the same thing for the papers that appear there, over and over. We find a relevant paper -> citations and we "unfold" the entire tree up to the present where we find papers that have not been cited yet. At that point we'll have collected no more than 50 tabs in the browser that we can begin to work through. If we have a meta-analysis or literature review written in the year X we can usually avoid paying attention to work published before year X. If there are more than one meta-analysis or literature reviews, it still pays to read them both to see what has changed in the literature.

In the process of reading, we may come across reserachers names a lot, in that case it may be worth to search them on google, they may have written Op-eds, or perhaps even blogposts where they talk about their research. Blogs are more efficient than papers, so reading those is also useful. If we find the authors on twitter, we can try a keywords search on their tweets, because it can be that in the past people have asked them the same question that we have, and those answers may already be available.

In sum, we fid relevant papers and unfold them until we reach the present. Which leads us to: How do we choose what to read?

NB: A special case is when there is a Handbook on the topic. If there is, we should read everything there that is relevant, and only then move on to unfold the handbook as described above. Handbooks are meant to be the outcome that we want, so just with the handbooks we might get 80% of the value; except if the handbook is old, in which case some fact cited there might have been challenged in later research.

## Choosing the papers

I mentioned one criteria already, reading meta/systematic papers. But other than that, what can we do? First, filtering on the title, looking for titles that address the specific question we have in mind. For example, if we search [_us health expenditures_](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=us+health+expenditures&btnG=) we get 10 papers in the front page. Out of those, the useful ones are _Eliminating waste in US healthcare_ and _Trends in US health care spending, 2001_. The output might also make use realise that our query wasn't specific enough. Do we want a time-series? Do we want to focus on waste, or geographical variation? Then we can try to add the keywords _historical_ or _trend_ to the search.

We need not worry about missing papers in our first pass, if they are important enough they'll be picked up by papers later down in our unfolding process.

Sometimes we might doubt whether or not a paper (or book, as google scholar also indexes books) is relevant just from the title. Then we can read the abstract. For example if we were interested in the relation between war and technological progress we might search _us war innovation_, and we find something that's called _US military innovation since the cold war_. But we click on it, and it's not what we wanted, so we close it and move on. If a source is not relevant, it doesn't require unfolding.

## Identifying good papers

I will be writing a separate post on this, but for now I'll say that it is worth, before starting the research process, to think about the topic and what variables may be of interest, what things one should control for. With this a priori model then we can judge the papers, and update the model with what we read. For example for

- War and innovation, we have to take into account different kinds of innovations, whether or not an innovation not happening on year X will be much delayed, there's also the idea of misallocation of resources that may happen because of war, the fact that the number of scientists and engineers is not infinite, and so on.
- For social science studies in general, we want to pay attention at least at the sample size, the p-values, and the design of the study. Randomized studies or natural experiments are preferable to mere correlational designs. And keep in mind the golden rule of literature reviews: For every paper claiming X, there is an opposite paper claiming not X, so we have to be careful not to run away with just one paper.

## Step by step

1. Think about the topic of interest and what your expectations are, as outlined in the previous section. Think also of how much time you want to spend on doing the review.
2. Search a set of keywords in google scholar, for every good match (as outlined in this document), open the paper in a new tab, and also open the citations in a new tab. Continue exploring, you can either go to the tabs you just opened and repeat the process, or explore the initial results.
3. Try verious keywords
4. Read what you got. Most of the reading will actually be skimming, and not every paper skimmed will turn out to be useful.
5. Once there is a semi-solid conclusion, search authors on google and twitter. Search the keywords on google too to find blog discussions.
6. (Optional) It may be sometimes necessary (I've done it only once) to email an author to clarify.

## YOLO

You only live once, so you better spend your time wisely. What if you just want a good enough overview of a topic and are time constrained?

Then, stick to the systematic reviews and meta-analysis, instead of reading the papers, read their literature reviews. Limit your search in google scholar to recent material (eg last 5 years).
